# Insurance Claims Data Platform

## Business Problem

An insurance company receives claims data from multiple sources. The incoming data may contain duplicate records, missing values, invalid formats, and inconsistent information.

The goal of this project is to build an Azure Data Engineering pipeline that ingests, validates, transforms, and prepares insurance claims data for analytics.
